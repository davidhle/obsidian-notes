# Physiological Computing Review
#WiSe2020 
## Topics
### 1: [[Intro to Physiological Computing]]
1.  Mental status determination
    -   Implicit info, unintentional, activity arises spontaneously
2.  Body scheme extensions
    -   Information is carried out intentionally, activity involves volitional thoughts (BCIs, Neuroprosthetics, Biofeedback)

-   Know about the depicted differences, about the biocybernetic loop and the associated requirements (validity, reliability)
-   Read the provided pdf "Physiological computing"
			Possible exam question: What is the difference between implicit and explicit information in physiological computing systems?

	### 2a: [[Central Nervous System]]
Know about the main functions, about the role of neurons, about the "major" parts of the brain, and their functional role (brain areas we talked about in more detail), especially about the role of the cerebral cortex and its areas. Also, know about differences between voluntary movements and the mechanisms of reflex arcs on spinal level

Possible exam questions:
-   Which components are part of the central nervous system?
-   Which part of the cerebral cortex processes mainly visual information?
	-   What is the role of the Amygdala?
			-   Attaches emotions to our perceptions

### 2b: [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
Know about the classification of the functional divisions (preferably scheme 2), about the difference between sympathetic and parasympathetic activation, about the concept of homeostasis and how the mechanisms of thermoregulation.

Possible exam questions:
-   How is the peripheral nervous system subdivided?
-   Explain the purpose/mechanisms of vasoconstriction on a cold day outside

### 3a: [[Electroencephalography (EEG)]]
Know about the mechanisms of the EEG origin (post-synaptic potentials) and the suggested role of the thalamus; about the various spontaneous rhythms and the principle of the „alpha-blockade“. Also, inform yourself about the event-related potentials and the influences that shape the P300 component

Possible exam questions:
-   What kind of EEG-rhythm is associated with relaxed wakefulness?
-   Indicate the P300 in this illustration and name one influencing factor that shapes the amplitude?

### 3b: [[Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)]]
Know about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous approaches, about the advantages and disadvantages of low frequency-based BCIs and about the mechanisms of action in P300-based BCIs

Possible exam questions:
-   Why does a P300-based BCI require high attention from the user?
-   What's the difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous BCI?

### 4: [[Eye Movements & Cognitive Pupillometry]]
Know about the role of the fovea during visual processing (including the distribution of rods and cones in the retina) and about the concept of valence/arousal, cognitive load and their influence on pupil diameter. Also, know about the role of saccades, fixations (and their interaction), about smooth pursuit eye-movements and about the various applications of eye-movement research

Possible exam questions:
-   Pupil diameter is usually referred to as an „unspecific measure“. What does that mean?
-   How do we usually explore our visual environment? Argue on the basis of our field of view.

### 5: [[Emotions & Behavior]]
Know roughly about the theory of somatic markers, and about the three components of emotions and the dimensional approach to assess emotional experience. Also, know about the origin of the skin conductance response, the difference between SCL and SCR and about the relevant parameters of an SCR

Possible exam questions:

-   Name the three components of an emotional reaction
-   Include the „sound of an angry barking dog“ into the arousal/valence diagram

### 6: [[Biofeedback]]
				Know about the basic principle, especially in association with „stress-tests“ during biofeedback therapy. Also, know about the concept of „interoceptive awareness and get an impression of exemplary BCI scenarios

				Possible exam questions:
				-   Illustrate a BCI scenario for relaxation featuring SCR
