# Emotions & Behavior
> The brain observes the peripheral activity within target organs that are innervated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and this activity is supposed to influence our behavior and guide our decisions - the body itself is a part of a feedback loop that informs the brain about the status of the environment
## Theories on emotional processing & somatic markers
___
### Theories of emotion
- What is the James-Lange theory of emotion?
- What is the Canon-Bard theory?
- What is the theory of somatic markers?
	- bodily responses act as somatic markers that influence cognition and modulate behavior
	- assumes during emotional processing, frontal brain areas are activated and this activation ("marker") represents a specific bodily or somatic state
	- those representation are labeled: (un)pleasant
	- the representation are activated (without us knowing) during reaction/decision making and provide us with "preliminary" decisions and "push" decisions into a specific direction
### Three components of an emotion
> Physiological measures determine the functional consequences of sympathetic and parasympathetic activation changes
- What are the three components of an emotion?
	- **physiological response**: heart beats faster, skeletal muscles tense, sweating, pupils dilate
	- **cognitive component**: attention is shifted to the critical event/object, thoughts of fear or failing
	- **behavioral reaction**: readiness to act: fight, flight, avoidance
- What is the dimensional approach?
	- a rating on valence and arousal scale to determine an emotional scale that psychologists use
	- ![[Dimensional Approach.png]]
	- pleasure/valence: negative/positive
	- arousal: (central nervous) activation
- Include the „sound of an angry barking dog“ into the arousal/valence diagram
	- Probably the bottom right quadrant since it's more arousing (because of fear) than a crying baby and it is unpleasant
	
## Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
> EDA: umbrella term for changes in the electrical properties of the skin
> Skin conductance: electrical conductance of the skin

- EDA: SCL & SCR
	- ![[SCL SCR.png]]
___
### Measurement
> Sweating leads to a **decrease of electrical resistance** and therefore an **increase in skin conductance**!
- How can skin conductance be quantified?
	- by applying a low undetectable voltage between 2 points on the skin using electrodes and then measuring the current flow between them (exosomatic approach); signals are triggered by changes in resistance
	- measured in microsiemens (μS)

### Sweat Glands
> increase in sympathetic activity = increase in secretion/sweat glands activity = increase in skin conductance
- What is the general purpose of sweat glands?
	- thermoregulation
- Why are skin conductance responses (SCRs) the most useful index to depict changes in sympathetic activation due to emotional and cognitive states?
	- because sweat glands are exclusively innervated by the sympathetic nervous system

### Connection Brain-Sweat Glands
> Input from the amygdala activates the regulatory function of the hypothalamus. then, sympathetic and parasympathetic division are triggered and sweat secretion is initiated (among others)
- What is the hypothalamus?
	- the central brain area that controls functions related to the maintenance of life; controls the autonomous nervous system
- What does electrical stimulation of hypothalamic areas result in?
	- typically sympathetic responses including constrictions of blood vessels or sweating/secretion

### Taxonomy of the EDA Complex
> There are two main components of electrodermal activity: the background tonic activity also known as **skin conductance level (SCL)** and rapid phasic components also known as **skin conductance response (SCR)**
- What is the difference between SCR and SCL?
	- Skin conductance level refers to the overall level of bodily arousal,  creates a slow moving baseline, and is constantly changing
	- Skin conductance response builds upon the SCL but makes up a small proportion of the whole complex
- What is an event-related scr (ER-SCR)?
	- an SCR that appears in response to a stimulus (1-5 seconds)
- What is a non-specific SCR (NS-SCR)?
	- an SCR that appears without any obvious/external cause
- What are the relevant parameters of an SCR?
	- **Latency**
		- the temporal distance between the stimulus and the initiation of the response
	- **Rise time/period**
		- the time that the response needs to reach the peak amplitude
	- **Amplitude**
		- the absolute difference between the peak response and the onset of the SCR
	- **Threshold**
		- a range that determines if a signal is considered to be an SCR or NS-SCR (between 0.04μS and 0.01μS)
	- **Recover**
		- the time between the peak response and the full recovery to the baseline or to the half-life response
		- provides info on how long a state of arousal lasts after confrontation with an effective stimulus

### A Common Problem
A challenge in analyzing skin conductance data is separating the SCR from the SCL because another SCR may occur which adds to the overall activity and can lead to an underestimation of the SCR amplitude
- because the true trough is hidden within the slow decline of the previous peak of activity
