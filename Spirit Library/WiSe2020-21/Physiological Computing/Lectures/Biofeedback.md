# Biofeedback
> Biofeedback instruments are used to **provide feedback information about physiological processes** and assist the individual to **increase awareness** of these processes and to **gain voluntary control over body and mind**
- What is biofeedback?
	- a technique that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance
- What is interoceptive awareness?
	- The ability to recognize one's own physiological states
	- It's associated with our ability to determine hunger, muscle fatigue, sources of pain, etc.
- Why is interoceptive awareness beneficial for emotional well-being?
- positively associated with the ability to recognize one's emotions
- positively associated with the ability to down-regulate negative effects
- What is a stress test during biofeedback therapy?
	- a rapid succession of annoying/fear-driven images/sounds from standardized inventories
	- in the biofeedback data (skin conductance, heart rate, temperature, respiration etc.) you should be able to see the effect of the stimuli activating the sympathetic system and the influence of the parasympathetic system during relaxation/recovery
- Illustrate a BCI scenario for relaxation featuring SCR
	- Beat saber: start off with a slow pace of having to cut blocks/easy difficulty to establish baseline, increase speed and difficulty of song to stimulate an SCR, and then switch back to a slower song/difficulty (maybe implement motion to hit blocks to mimic tai chi movements)
	- to see if there could be a correlation between game difficulty and skin conductance -> could be used to develop a training system in the game
