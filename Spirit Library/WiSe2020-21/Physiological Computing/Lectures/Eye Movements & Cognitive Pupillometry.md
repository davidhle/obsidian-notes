Know about the role of the fovea during visual processing (including the distribution of rods and cones in the retina) and about the concept of valence/arousal, cognitive load and their influence on pupil diameter. Also, know about the role of saccades, fixations (and their interaction), about smooth pursuit eye-movements and about the various applications of eye-movement research

Possible exam questions:
-   How do we usually explore our visual environment? Argue on the basis of our field of view.
# Eye Movements & Cognitive Pupillometry
## Pupillary Muscles

### The Sphincter Muscle
- What is the sphincter muscle and what does it do?
	- a muscle in the iris that controls the amount of light that reaches the back of the eye (retina) and is innervated by the parasympathetic division of the ANS

### The Dilator Muscle


## Pupillary Responses
**Arousal:** a state of physiological activation; describes the general degree of activation of the nervous system and changes in arousal are accompanied by changes in physiological parameters

### Pupil Diameter and Arousal
> Pupil diameter increases with arousal, and some studies indicate that negative stimuli evoke stronger pupil reactions compared to positive stimuli
- Pupil diameter is usually referred to as an „unspecific measure“. What does that mean?
	- It means that it doesn't allow to differentiate between positive or. negative stimuli (valence)

### Pupil Diameter and Cognitive Load
- High cognitive processing demands require high level of central nervous activation (arousal)
- Pupil diameter differentiates between states of low to moderate workload and then plateaus, making it hard to differentiate between high and very high
