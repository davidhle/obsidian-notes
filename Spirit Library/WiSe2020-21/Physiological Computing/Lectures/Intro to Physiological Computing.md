# Intro to Physiological Computing
> Physiological computing systems can be divided into 2 categories:
## 1. Mental Status Determination
> Implicit information, unintentional, activity arises spontaneously

*The description of psychological states via physiological activity*
- What is the difference between implicit and explicit information in physiological computing systems?

- What does mental status determination deal with?
	- the internal psychological states including mental workload, emotions, and motivation

## 2. Body scheme extensions
> Information is carried out intentionally, actively involves volitional thoughts (BCIs, Neuroprosthetics, Biofeedback)

Manipulation of *sensorimotor activity*
- Integration of the sensory system and the motor system enables us to use sensory information to carry out motor actions; also, motor activity drives sensory processing
- Sensory-motor integration is supposed to create an individual body scheme.
	- Incoming sensory information from skin/muscles/limbs creates a postural model, a sensation of body position/dimensions
	- The model keeps track of the limb positions and is crucial for action control
- Body scheme functions are guided by a sense of agency: "I am doing this"
- During body scheme extensions, our usual boundaries expand beyond the nervous system

## The Biocybernetic Loop
- What is the Biocybernetic Loop?
	- A concept for physiological computing systems composed of three stages: collection, analysis, and translation
	- ![[Biocybernetic Loop.png]]
	- Stage 1: collection
		- physiological data is collected via sensors
	- Stage 2: analysis
		- data is filtered and quantified in an appropriate way and are identified and corrected for artifacts
	- Stage 3: translation
		- data is analyzed to achieve a reasonable and accurate quantification of physiological data that is then **translated into a command** that is executed at the human-computer interface
- What are the important requirements of the biocybernetic loop?
	- Validity
		- The physiological measures of psychological concepts must be validated
	- Reliability
		- The sensors need to collect appropriate data
	- Real-time analysis & classification of data
	- Responsive and coherent translation from data to command

## Extra Info from PDF
- What is physiological computing?
	- the use of human physiological data as system inputs in real time which enables the creation of user-state representation so that software can respond dynamically and specifically to changes in the user's psycho-physiological state
- Emerging research themes for physiological computing
	- sensor development
	- real-time signal processing in the field
	- interference processing (e.g., between psychological states and objective measures)
	- data classification methods
	- interface/interaction design
