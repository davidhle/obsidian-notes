# Electroencephalography (EEG)
Know about the mechanisms of the EEG origin (post-synaptic potentials) and the suggested role of the thalamus; about the various spontaneous rhythms and the principle of the „alpha\-blockade“. Also, inform yourself about the event-related potentials and the influences that shape the P300 component

- What kind of EEG-rhythm is associated with relaxed wakefulness?
- Indicate the P300 in this illustration and name one influencing factor that shapes the amplitude
- What is the connection of oscillations to the brain?
- How are electrodes placed on the scalp (what system)?
- What influences the P300?
- Can you think of an experiment to induce a P300?

## Mechanisms of Origin
### Synaptic Transmission
**How it works :)**
> 1. Action potential travels across axon and arrives at the synaptic ending of the sending neuron
> 2. Release of neurotransmitters that bind to receptors of the post-synapse (receiving neuron)
> 3. Opening of ion channels, positively/negatively charged ions enter/leave receiving neuron - postsynaptic potentials
> 4. Change in post-synaptic potential
	> **Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) ("depolarization)"**: potential change that makes the post-synaptic neuron more likely to fire/produce an action potential
	> **Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) ("hyperpolarization")**: prevents neuron from firing because of the flow of negative ions into cell/positive ions out of cell

### Postsynaptic Potentials
> If an **excitatory synapse activates** at the apical dendrites of a pyramid cell and **releases its excitatory neurotransmitters**, the **transmitters bind to the postsynaptic neuron** and **positively charged ions flow** into the latter neuron which **produce a negativity** on the outside of the cell region of the apical dendrites

> SIMULTANEOUSLY positively charged ions **flow out of the cell body** and **create a positivity** in that area. Negativity @ apical dendrites & positivity @ cell body = electric dipole!! (pair of + & - electric charges separated by a small distance)

- What do we measure with EEG?
	- We measure the neural activity of a brain represented by the **sum of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials** in thousands to millions of cortical pyramidal neurons
	- differences in electrical potentials between two points
- What are the special neurons called that are important for the EEG?
	- Pyramid cells
- What's the right circumstances to record EPSPs & IPSPs?
	- a parallel alignment of apical dendrites of pyramid neurons
- How can the sum of activity be detected?
	- on the scalp via surface electrodes (EEG)

## EEG Setup
### Electrodes
- How is EEG data collected?
	- through scalp electrodes which are attached using a conductive gel and attached to individual wires

### 10-20 system
- What does the 10-20 system refer to?
	- The system of electrode placement: the distances between electrodes are either 10% or 20% of the total front - back or right - left distance
Each electrode placement site has a letter denoting which area of the brain it's measuring: frontal, central, parietal, occipital

### Ground Electrodes and Referencing

### EEG-graphs


## Cognitive Electrophysiology: What can the EEG tell us?
 

### Oscillatory EEG activity
 

### Event-related potentials (ERP)
- What are ERPs?
	- small cortical reactions generated in response to specific sensory or cognitive events
	- can be elicited by a wide variety of sensory, cognitive and motor events
	- reflect the summed activity of postsynaptic potentials produced by a large number of similarly oriented pyramidal neurons
- How can ERPs be measured?
	- because they are very small and are hidden in the noise of the background EEG, they have to be visualized through averaging techniques
- What's the difference between sensory/exogenous components and  cognitive/endogenous components?
	- exogenous/sensory components depend on the physical parameters of a stimulus and occur within the first 100 ms after stimulus presentation (early components)
	- cognitive/endogenous reflect conscious information processing and are generated roughly after 100 ms; shaped by psychological parameters
