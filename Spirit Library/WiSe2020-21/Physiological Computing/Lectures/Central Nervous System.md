# Central Nervous System
## Introduction
- What do we mean when we refer to "light" or "visible light"
	- a small spectrum of frequencies from the electromagnetic spectrum that stimulate the receptors in the retina of our eyes (700 - 400 nanometers)
	- ![[Visible Light Spectrum.png]]
- The amount of stimuli around us is very high and we only select few information for conscious processing
	- because the processing capacity of our cognitive system is limited

## The Nervous System
> The nervous system is made of 2 parts that work together: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The nervous system controls and coordinates all essential functions and allows the body to maintain homeostasis
- What are the main functions of the nervous system?
	- **sensory function**: to gather information from inside and outside the system
	- **integration function**: process and integrate the information
	- **motor function**: send the information to effector organs (muscles or glands) or to initiate a motor response
- What is the key difference between neurons and other cells in the human body?
	- neurons are specialized to transmit information throughout the body and are responsible for sending and receiving signals
- Where do sensory/afferent neurons transmit information?
	- from tissues and organs into the CNS
	- also to and from the brain
- Where do motor/efferent neurons transmit signals?
	- from the CNS to the effectors (organs and muscles)
	- also to and from the brain
- What are interneurons?
	- they connect neurons within specific regions of the CNS
- What are the basic parts of a neuron?
	- soma: a cell body which contains the nucleus
	- dendrites: extensions of the soma which carry nerve impulses toward the soma
	- axon: a cable-like projection which carries nerve impulses away from the soma to another neuron or to an effect organ

- What is white matter in the nervous system?
	- it's made up of myelin which surrounds axons
- What is the gray matter of the nervous system composed of?
	- cell bodies and axons that don't have a myelin layer
- What is a synapse?
	- the junction between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector organ (muscle or gland)

**There are about 80-90 BILLION neurons in the brain!**

### The Central Nervous System
- Which components are part of the central nervous system?
	- the brain and the spinal cord
	- ![[Central Nervous System.png]]

### The Brain
- What are the two major components of the forebrain?
	- the telencephalon and the diencephalon
- Why can an earthworm integrate neural activation within each segment of its body without input from the brain?
	- clusters of cell bodies are not restricted to the head region, but also occur in various locations along a nerve chord
- What is the telencephalon?
	- where brain functions such as thinking, planning, reasoning, language processing/interpreting are realized
	- largest structure of the brain

#### The Cerebral Cortex
> the outer hemisphere of the telencephalon comprised of 2 hemispheres and 4 lobes: **frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal**. Right hemisphere is responsible for left side of body and left is responsible for right side.

	- General

	- Primary sensory areas
		- ![[Cerebral Cortex Primary Sensory Areas.png]]
	- Somatosensory Cortex
		- ![[Somatosensory Cortex.png]]
- Which part of the cerebral cortex processes mainly visual information?
	- in the **primary visual cortex** which is in the **occipital lobe**
- Which part of the cerebral cortex processes mainly auditory information?
	- in the **primary auditory cortex** which is located in the **temporal cortex**
- Which part of the cerebral cortex processes sensory information from receptors that detect touch, pain or the position of the body in space/
	- the **primary somatosensory cortex**
- Where is sensory info from the body or environment sent to?
	- the respective primary sensory cortex of the contralateral (opposite side) hemisphere
	- e.g., the primary somatosensory cortex of the left hemisphere learns what the right hand is holding
- What is the corpus callosum?
	- the bridge between the hemispheres of the cerebral cortex where information is exchanged
- What is the region in the cerebral cortex that is most directly involved in the control of movements?
	- The **primary motor cortex**
- What is the frontal lobe/cortex/prefrontal cortex?
	- where higher executive functions including emotional regulation, planning (ethical) reasoning and problem solving occur
- What happened when Phineas Gage had damage to his left frontal lobe?
	- his personality changed
- Which hemisphere is responsible for language and speech?
	- left
	- **Broca's area (frontal lobe)**: speech production
	- **Wernicke's area (temporal lobe)**: speech comprehension
	- ![[Broca and Wernicke.png]]
- What is aphasia?
	- disorder of speech production/comprehension and/or reading/writing
	- the type of aphasia depends on the brain area that is damaged
		- **Broca-Aphasia** = speech production damaged
		- **Wernicke-Aphasia** = speech comprehension damaged
- Which lobe detects touch, pain or the position of the body in space?
	- The parietal lobe: the parietal cortex includes the primary somatosensory cortex
- What is two-point discrimination?
	- Our ability derive from touch alone that two objects are touching the skin at nearby points rather than only one object
- What is the basal ganglia?
	- a structure responsible for programming and executing (repetitive) motor functions - uncontrolled movements & tremors when affected (e.g., Parkinson's disease)
- What does the limbic system contain?
	- mainly the **amygdala** and the **hippocampus**
- What is the role of the Amygdala?
	- it plays a role in our emotional responses, including feelings like pleasure, fear, anxiety and anger
	- it attaches emotional content to perceptions and memories
- What can be used to determine increased/decreased amygdala activity?
	- measuring changes in blood oxygen level (**hemodynamic response**)
- What is the hippocampus?
	- The memory center of our brain where our episodic memories are formed and filed in the long-term storage across other parts of the cerebral cortex
	- responsible for the acquisition of new memories or processing episodic memories together with the amygdala
- What are the main parts of the diencephalon?
	- Thalamus	
		- a relay center that passes information from sensory nerves or from the body to the cerebral cortex where it is processed
	- Hypothalamus
		- located under the thalamus, it controls the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine systems (chemical system comprising of hormones released by internal glands)
		- organizes behavior related to survival, the 4 Fs: fighting, fleeing, feeding and "mating" ;)
### The Spinal Cord
#### Voluntary Movement
1. Sensory input
2. Integration (processing info in motor cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum)
3. Motor output
#### Spinal Reflex Arcs
> Spinal reflexes are initiated and completed at the spinal cord level and without the involvement of higher brain centers
1. Receptor reacts to stimulus
2. Afferent/sensory neuron transmits impulses to CNS
3. Interneuron
4. Efferent/motor neuron transmits impulses from CNS to effector
5. Effector (muscle fiber or glands) responds by contracting or secreting
