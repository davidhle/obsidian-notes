# Peripheral Nervous System
- How is the peripheral nervous system subdivided?
	- **Autonomic Nervous System**
		- communicates with internal organs and glands
	- **Somatic Nervous System**
		- communicates with sense organs and voluntary muscles

## Autonomic Nervous System
> Regulates processes that are unconscious that keep our body alive and carry out functions such as breathing or the regulation of the heartbeat
- What is the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system?
	- "Fight or flight response"
	- Most active under stressful circumstances, and is responsible for priming the body for action
- What is the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system?
	- "Rest and digest system"/"Feed and breed system"
	- Conserves energy as it slows the heart rate or relaxes muscles
	- Balances out the reaction of the sympathetic division

## Homeostasis
> A state of relative stability within the body and is critical because our body can only survive within a narrow range of conditions
- What happens to the hairs on our skin when we're too cold?
	- they stand up to trap more warm air and reduce heat lost
	- too hot?
		- lays down to increase heat loss
- Why do we sweat when we're hot?
	- glands under the skin produce sweat onto the surface of the skin so that they can evaporate and cool the body
- Why do we shiver when we're cold?
	- shivering: involuntary contraction & relaxation of muscles
	- releases energy to be released as heat and warm us up
- Explain the purpose/mechanisms of vasoconstriction on a cold day outside
	- Our blood vessels will transport blood to the skin and constrict (**vasoconstriction**) to carry out thermoregulation and maintain homeostasis
- How do Inuit people maintain homeostasis?
	- their nervous system **fluctuates between vasoconstriction and vasodilation** to conserve body heat and provide continued blood flow to prevent frostbite
