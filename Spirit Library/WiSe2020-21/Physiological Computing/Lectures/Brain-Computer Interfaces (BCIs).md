# Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
> **Synchronous BCIs rely on stimulation** and the provided EEG data is event-related (e.g., flashing on a screen)
> **Asynchronous BCIs provide no cue** for the BCI algorithms with regard to the onset o the relevant EEG signals

## Asynchronous BCIs: ERD/ERS-based systems
> Rely on neural oscillations over sensorimotor cortex (primary motor cortex [movement processing] & primary somatosensory cortex [touch, heat, pain])
- When does an event-related synchronization occur?
	- When the body does not process any movements like when eyes are closed and when no visual input is processed
- When does an event-related desynchronization occur?
	- during any body movement and the EEG frequency shifts from alpha to beta oscillations (like opening your eyes

## Synchronous BCIs: SSVEP-based systems
**Steady State Visual Evoked Potential**

	- Frequencies > 30Hz
		- Less annoying
		- Lower risk of photosensitive seizures
		- Higher challenge to detect SSVEP from EEG due to poor signal-to-noise ratio

## Synchronous BCIs: P300-based systems
- What is the oddball-paradigm?
	- The use of presenting a deviant stimuli from time to time while showing the participant a series of the same stimuli - usually produces a P300
	- The participant is instructed to be attentive to the deviant stimuli (e.g., to count them)
