## Good Reasons to Use Heuristic Evaluation

-   It’s fast, quick and cheap to conduct a heuristic evaluation. This is especially true if you are only going to use a single evaluator.
-   It provides good insight into possible [usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability "What is Usability?") problems that might damage the user experience.

## Reasons to be Cautious about Using Heuristic Evaluations

-   A single evaluator may miss issues that are not readily apparent to them. The use of more than one evaluator is recommended.
-   Heuristic analysis is subjective. It does not “prove” anything and thus findings may be open to debate.
-   Experienced evaluators are hard to come by and that means that you may need to use less skilled evaluators whose findings may not be as valuable.

## How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for Usability

There is a simple process to follow to conduct a heuristic analysis for HCI usability:

### Know What You Will Test and How

Before you begin any form of [usability testing](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability-testing "What is Usability Testing?") or [user research](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-research "What is User Research?") it is essential for you to have an objective for your testing. You really need to be articulate: What will you test? (The whole product or just a sign up page, for example?) How will you test? How will you ensure the evaluators understand this?

### Understand Your Users

You also need some background on your users. This form of testing doesn’t involve users but your evaluators need to be able to act on behalf of the user – that means they need to know the target audience and what they expect to achieve from the interaction. It can be very useful to supply the evaluator with user [personas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/personas "What are Personas?") to achieve this understanding. If your evaluators don’t operate from a user’s perspective the analysis may lack focus or fail to provide the specific insights that you need to improve the product.

### Decide on the Heuristics to be Used

Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich designed a set of 10 heuristics that can be used to evaluate HCI usability in 1990. Nielsen later revised the heuristics in 1994 to deliver the following 10 heuristics:

![](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/bc407d74dd91972a7370c0e22cfacc36.jpg)  

-   **Visibility of the system’s status.** Users should be given feedback on what is happening within a reasonable timescale.
-   **Match between the system and real world.** Information should be presented in a means familiar to the user including language and conventions rather than terms developed for the system. Information should be presented in a logical order.
-   **User control and freedom.** Users make mistakes. There should be an “emergency exit” which is easy to find and exit the current system state without having to jump through hoops. Undo and redo functions are essential.
-   **Consistency and standards.** Words, actions, situations, etc. should always mean the same thing and users should be able to understand that.
-   **Error prevention.** Preventing error is better than clear error messages. Eliminate error conditions or make users aware that they may be about to occur and ask them if they want to proceed.
-   **Recognition rather than recall.** Reduce the load on a user’s memory. Make actions, options, and objects visible. Users shouldn’t have to remember things from one screen to the next. Instructions should be easy to access when needed.
-   **Flexibility and efficiency of use.** The use of accelerators, where appropriate, may be invisible to new users but improve the efficiency of use for experienced users. Actions could be customized by users.
-   **Aesthetics and [minimalist design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/minimalist-design "What is Minimalist Design?").** Dialogue should not give irrelevant or rarely useful information. The more data in dialogue the more it diminishes the overall visibility of individual points for the user.
-   **Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from error.** This means error messages should be in clear language and avoid the use of codes. They should explain the problem and offer a solution to that problem.
-   **Help and documentation.** The best approach is to construct a system which needs no help or documentation but if it is necessary – it should be easy to search, be based on the tasks the user wishes to execute, offer concrete steps to follow and be kept to a minimum.

It is worth noting that while Nielsen’s heuristics are those most commonly employed to carry out heuristic evaluation – they are not set in stone. You are free to add additional heuristics, remove heuristics and amend them as you see fit to deliver a usable interface for your user base.

### Conduct the Heuristic Walkthrough

Evaluators should conduct the walkthrough independently of each other – to give the broadest range of input without “group think” occurring during the process. They should record any issues that they encounter on a piece of paper or electronically and explain which heuristic has been violated and why.

So let’s say that an evaluator finds that when they enter a new password it needs to contain a special character (e.g. # or $ or % etc.) but that this isn’t shown on the instructions and without that character – the system displays an error. This would conflict with the idea of “error prevention” and should be noted as such.

### Collect and Analyze Results

This is simply a roundup of all the evaluators’ comments into a single report. This report can be marked with severity ratings, if you desire, to enable rapid deployment of resources to fix the problems identified.

## Heuristic Analysis and Information Visualization

Information visualization is a relatively new discipline from a formal perspective and it is only the recent boom in “big data” which has transformed the use of interaction visualization from static perspectives (diagrams) into interactive systems. In theory, it should be straightforward to conduct a heuristic analysis of an [information visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization "What is Information Visualization?"), however there is no set of “off-the-shelf” heuristics for information visualization assessment (unlike for HCI which was shown above).

This means that to some extent the researcher will need to define their own heuristics which may be based on the HCI heuristics. This is perfectly OK but does introduce the risks of missing usability problems during an information visualization heuristic analysis because of the lack of a particular heuristic.

## The Take Away

Heuristic analysis is easy and cheap to conduct. It is best used with computer interfaces and conducted by experienced researchers. However, experience comes over time and even an inexperienced evaluator can add value by using this process. It is more challenging to use when it comes to information visualization as there is no clearly defined set of heuristics for information visualization though researchers can adapt them from HCI.

You should also try to keep in mind what the Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman has to say about heuristics; “By their very nature, heuristic shortcuts will produce biases” and try to ensure that wherever possible your use of heuristics is objective rather than subjective.

# 10 Usability Heuristics with Examples

User Experience is a qualitative metric subject to many factors. It’s an evolving discipline and it’s evident when the forerunner of great user experiences, Apple, humbly tags their [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/) as Beta. Google termed their [material design](https://material.google.com/) guidelines as a living document which will be updated regularly. One of the pioneers who tried to objectively evaluate the user experience on digital platforms is Jakob Nielsen with his [heuristic evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation). Though they date back to the 90’s, these general rules of thumb are still valid and are used today.

In this article, I attempt to explain these 10 rules in common language with examples:

## **1\. Visibility of System Status:**

When we were working on a 3rd party API for image cropping in our [TutorsWeb](https://www.tutorsweb.com/) application, we observed one usability issue. When the user uploads an image for cropping, he/she needs to wait until the image appears on screen with the square box. Depending on internet speed, this load time varies for many users. There is no way for the user to know if he needs to wait or continue to the next page.

This principle states that the user should know what’s going on inside the system. We need to give a feedback of his/her action within a reasonable time. This feedback is normally associated with points of action and can be provided using a color change, loader, time-left graphics, etc.

One example is twitter making a swoosh sound when a tweet is being posted. Another example is Google Drive showing the status of a document upload.

## **2\. Match between system and the real world:**

Is there something on your application that a user may not understand? This is very common to miss since we get associated with the product for over a period of time. It’s also important for the application to speak the language of the target user base.

- Neil Patel could very well say “Sign Up” on his landing page. Instead, he chose to say ambitiously — “Yes, I want Neil to teach me how to grow my Business!”. It sets the context and speaks the everyday language.

## **3\. User Control and Freedom:**

- This principle talks about giving the user the freedom to navigate and perform actions. The freedom to undo any accidental actions. This principle can be best illustrated by the Gmail’s flash message with undo action when we accidentally delete an email.
	- ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1978/1*85dIRmZl76vxpgnX4AHf9g.png)

## **4\. Consistency and Standards:**

Consistency is the key. A Submit button in one page should look the same across the site on any page. 
- If we show the data in a particular table format on one page, it should look the same the next time data is being shown in tabular format. If the header is displayed in a certain way on the public pages, it should be the same when he/she logs in.
	- ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*XSp7VSgD1FyWQokg8G4FRQ.png)

How the same button can transform across different pages of the same site. Note that this is not a change of state.

Externally, it’s risk-less to follow the standard conventions. A “How It Works” link invokes similar expectation for a user across sites.
- Google Plus ambitiously launched “+1” to counter Facebook’s “Like” without much success. Facebook’s “Like” already became a standard and sites like LinkedIn adopted it without contesting.

## **5\. Error Prevention:**
How many times did your outlook remind you that there is no attachment in the email while you mentioned that something is attached? Outlook intuitively scans the email for such keywords and alerts the user before sending. This is Error Prevention.

- If you have set some rules for the format of user password, try to validate it as the user types rather than waiting for him to click submit.

## **6\. Recognition rather than recall:**

It’s always better to suggest the user a set of options than to let him remember and type the whole thing. The goal is to minimize the application of user memory.

- Below is an example of Quora suggesting possible questions based on what I am trying to type.
	- ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2212/1*SRvnHU_h5yA--h91LG-Zcg.png)

One more example is when Quora lets you pick the topics of interest from a list of options rather than asking you to type all of them which would have been disastrous.

## **7\. Flexibility and Efficiency of use:**

The Interface should be flexible transforming itself between a novice user and an advanced user. One frequents this option while installing a new software that asks if the user wants to go ahead with default installation or custom installation. An advanced user chooses a custom installation to cut out the unnecessary services.

- Below is an example of setting up Exchange on Android which hides the complex features under Advanced.

## **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design:**

Prioritization comes to play when this aspect is being considered. For the designer or the developer, all the information that’s being presented on the page is relevant. The product manager needs to ask the end user if it is so. Is every information displayed on interface necessary and useful?

- Google has been resisting the temptation to show more information on their search page for years. This is could be shown as the example of the best possible minimalist design.

- Interfaces need to be cleared of unnecessary elements and content that do not support the page goals and tasks. Apple provides only the basic information of feature hiding additional information under “Learn More”. Check the same product on a retail website to understand the importance of clutter-free experience.

## **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:**

Errors are inadvertent in the user journey. A check needs to be made if those errors are being explained to the user in understandable language. In the below example, I have entered a fictitious username and password and the error message I got is either the username or the password is incorrect. 

- Here we are not informing the user if the username is invalid or if the password is wrong.

- Below is the example of how MailChimp is handling this scenario:
	- ![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*LWTf6ANPhXt3QqCY.jpg)

A check needs to be done if exception handling is done across the application so that relevant messages can be shown to the user. Empty state messaging, 404, 500, etc are some examples.

## **10\. Help and Documentation:**

If a user has reached this step, something is not right with the interface. A great user interface lets the user navigate through it;s features without any documentation or training. But if there is any user who could not make it out, adequate help should be provided within the product.

- Below is an example of GoDaddy’s Help page. While there is a search field, there are main categories and frequently asked queries on the same page.

## Conclusion:

These guidelines are general rules of thumb and will mostly be applicable to any web & mobile application with some exceptions. Always use your judgment to implement these principles or any other UX practices by keeping yourself in end user’s shoes.
