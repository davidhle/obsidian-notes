Ben Shneiderman (born August 21, 1947) is an American computer scientist and professor at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. His work is comparable to other contemporary design thinkers like [Don Norman](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman "What is Don Norman?") and Jakob Nielsen. In his popular book "Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction", Shneiderman reveals his eight golden rules of interface design:

-   **Strive for consistency** by utilizing familiar icons, colors, menu hierarchy, call-to-actions, and [user flows](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-flows "What are User Flows?") when designing similar situations and sequence of actions. Standardizing the way information is conveyed ensures users are able to apply knowledge from one click to another; without the need to learn new representations for the same actions. Consistency plays an important role by helping users become familiar with the digital landscape of your product so they can achieve their goals more easily.
-   **Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.** With increased use comes the demand for quicker methods of completing tasks. For example, both Windows and Mac provide users with keyboard shortcuts for copying and pasting, so as the user becomes more experienced, they can navigate and operate the user interface more quickly and effortlessly.
-   **Offer informative feedback.** The user should know where they are at and what is going on at all times. For every action there should be appropriate, human-readable feedback within a reasonable amount of time. A good example of applying this would be to indicate to the user where they are at in the process when working through a multi-page questionnaire. A bad example we often see is when an error message shows an error-code instead of a human-readable and meaningful message.

_The Windows Media Player designers should have remembered Ben Shneiderman’s 3rd golden rule: Offer informative feedback. Poorly designed error messages often show an error-code that does not mean anything to the user. As a good designer you should always seek to give human-readable and meaningful feedback._

-   **Design dialogue to yield closure.** Don’t keep your users guessing. Tell them what their action has led them to. For example, users would appreciate a “Thank You” message and a proof of purchase receipt when they’ve completed an online purchase.
-   **Offer simple error handling.** No one likes to be told they’re wrong, especially your users. Systems should be designed to be as fool-proof as possible, but when unavoidable errors occur, ensure users are provided with simple, intuitive step-by-step instructions to solve the problem as quickly and painlessly as possible. For example, flag the text fields where the users forgot to provide input in an online form.
-   **Permit easy reversal of actions.** Designers should aim to offer users obvious ways to reverse their actions. These reversals should be permitted at various points whether it occurs after a single action, a [data entry](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/data-entry "What is Data Entry?") or a whole sequence of actions. As Shneiderman states in his book:  
      
    
    > This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone; it thus encourages exploration of unfamiliar options.
    
-   **Support internal locus of control.** Allow your users to be the initiators of actions. Give users the sense that they are in full control of events occurring in the digital space. Earn their trust as you design the system to behave as they expect.
-   **Reduce short-term memory load.** Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Therefore, interfaces should be as simple as possible with proper information hierarchy, and choosing recognition over recall. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a [test](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/test "What is Test?") because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory. Jakob Nielsen, a user advocate who’s been called one of the “world’s most influential designers” by Bloomberg Businessweek has invented several [usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability "What is Usability?") methods including [heuristic evaluation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristic-evaluation "What is Heuristic Evaluation?"). Recognition over recall is one of Nielsen’s ten usability [heuristics](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristics "What is Heuristics?") for interface design.

## Learn How Apple Integrates Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules

Apple Inc., a large North American technology company is a great example of how designs reflecting Shneiderman’s eight golden rules can lead to successful products. The company has achieved great success in everything from their Macintosh to their mobile devices. They pride themselves in their consistent, intuitive and beautiful designs. Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines, shared publicly in mid-2014, offers a glimpse into how their design team has been applying [design principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-principles "What are Design Principles?")like Shneiderman’s.

## 1. Consistency

“Consistency” and “Perceived Stability” are woven into the design of Apple’s Mac OS. The Mac OS Menu Bar is designed to contain consistent graphic elements regardless of whether it’s a version from the 1980’s or the 2010’s.

_The look of Mac OS over time. Mac OS Menu Bar stays consistent.

## 2. Shortcuts

As mentioned previously, Mac allows users to use a variety of keyboard shortcuts, commonly used examples include copy and paste (Command-C and Command-V), and taking screenshots (Command-Shift-3).

_Mac allow users to forgo mouse-clicks by providing them with keyboard shortcuts.  
_

## 3. Informative Feedback

A great example of visual feedback can be seen when a file becomes “highlighted” as the user clicks on a file on a Mac desktop. Another example is when the user drags a folder across the desktop, they can see the folder represented as physically being moved as they hold down their mouse.

_The folder is represented as physically being moved as the user holds down the mouse and drags a folder across the desktop._

## 4. Dialogue

As the user installs software to the Mac OS, an informative screen shows what step the user is currently at in their installation.

_As the user installs the program “Parallels Desktop 9”, it shows that it is currently “copying files”._

## 5. Error handling

During software installation, users are gently alerted with an informative message if an error was made. It is important to recognize when to use smaller, less intrusive alerts and when to use greater alerts to warn a user depending on the severity of the error at hand. However, it is almost never acceptable to punish the user when errors are made, so be cautious and select the right tone and the right language when drafting an error message that will ultimately be read by your human-users. So don’t simply leave an error-code to “handle” it!

_A gentle error message is shown explaining to the user what was happening and why it was happening. It even goes further to reassure the user, telling them that they are in control (see ‘Support Internal Locus of Control’ below) by explaining that this is due to their own security preference choices._

_A bad example by Windows displays an error message that uses the words “fatal” and “terminated”. Such negative, unfriendly words are sure to scare away most users!_

## 6. Permit reversal of actions

When users make an error in providing information during the installation process, they are allowed to go back to the previous step instead of being “punished” by having to start over.

_The user can undo a previous action quickly and easily._

## 7. Support internal locus of control

Give users the power to choose whether to continue running the program or exit from it. Mac’s Activity Monitor allows the user to ‘Force Quit’ when a program has unexpectedly crashed.

_The user is able to Quit or Force Quit a program if it crashes._

## 8. Reduce short-term memory load

As humans are only capable of retaining 5 items in our short term memory at one time, the Apple iPhone has stuck with allowing only 4 app icons to sit in the main menu area at the bottom of the screen. This decision does not only involve consideration of memory load but also considers consistency as well.

_Great examples of how Apple implements the rules of consistency (1st rule) by displaying the same bottom menu across different versions of the iOS. This is also a great example of how Apple reduces short-term memory load (8thrule). As humans are only capable of retaining 5 items in our short term memory at one time, the Apple iPhone has stuck with allowing only 4 app icons to sit in the main menu area at the bottom of the screen, regardless of whether it’s the iOS 4 or the iOS 7._

Designers need to solve problems every day, and finding the right solution involves in-depth research and carefully planned testing. It would be great to discover a one-size-fits-all approach or a secret formula that would automatically solve all our interface design issues. We might not have the answer for that yet, but we do know of certain shortcuts we can sometimes take. We also know about current trends, which you can read about in our guide to [UI and UX design trends for 2020](https://envato.com/blog/ux-and-ui-design-trends-2020/).  

“Heuristics” are simple and efficient rules that help us form judgements and make decisions. We can think of them as being general guidelines in terms of UI best practices. 

**Note**: these rules have their time and place, and are not a replacement for usability testing.  

While Jakob Nielsen’s [10 Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) is probably the most popular set of heuristics out there, there are others. Ben Shneiderman created one of the greatest guides to solid interaction design called [Designing the User Interface](https://books.google.pt/books?id=PpItDAAAQBAJ), which reveal his own collection of principles known as the “Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design”. We’re going to look at these rules today.

## 1. Strive for Consistency

Designing “consistent interfaces” means using the same design patterns and the same sequences of actions for similar situations. This includes, but isn’t limited to, the right use of color, typography and terminology in prompt screens, commands, and menus throughout your user journey. 

Remember: a consistent interface will allow your users to complete their tasks and goals much more easily.

## 2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**

Speaking of using UI rules as shortcuts, your users will benefit from shortcuts as well, especially if they need to complete the same tasks often. 

Expert users might find the following features helpful: 

-   Abbreviations
-   Function keys
-   Hidden commands
-   Macro facilities

## 3. Offer Informative Feedback

You need to keep your users informed of what is happening at every stage of their process. This feedback needs to be meaningful, relevant, clear, and fit the context.

## 4. Design Dialog to Yield Closure

Let me explain. Sequences of actions need to have a beginning, middle and end. Once a task is completed, give some peace of mind to your user by providing them informative feedback and well-defined options for the next step if that’s the case. Don’t keep them wondering!

## 5. Offer Simple Error Handling

A good interface should be designed to avoid errors as much as possible. But when errors do happen, your system needs to make it easy for the user to understand the issue and know how to solve it. Simple ways to handle errors include displaying clear error notifications along with descriptive hints to solve the problem.

## 6. Permit Easy Reversal of Actions

It’s an instant relief to find that “undo” option after a mistake is made. Your users will feel less anxious and more likely to explore options if they know there’s an easy way to reverse any accidents. 

This rule can be applied to any action, group of actions, or data entry. It can range from a simple button to a whole history of actions.

## 7. Support Internal Locus of Control

First, a definition:

> “In personality psychology, locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events” — [Julian Rotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Rotter)

It’s important to give control and freedom to your users so they’re able to feel they’re in charge of the system, not the other way round. Avoid surprises, interruptions, or anything that hasn’t be prompted by the users. 

Users should be the initiators of the actions rather than the responders.

[Permissions dialogs by Vlad Ponomarenko](https://dribbble.com/shots/2538098-Asking-Permissions)

## 8. Reduce Short-Term Memory Load

Our attention span is limited and anything we can do to make our users’ job easier, the better. It’s simpler for us to recognize information rather than recall it. Here, we can refer to one of Nielsen’s principles describing “[recognition over recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/)”. If we keep our interfaces simple and consistent, obeying to patterns, standards and conventions, we are already contributing to better recognition and ease of use. 

There are several features we can add to aid our users depending on their goals. For example, in an ecommerce environment, a list of recently viewed or purchased items.

## Conclusion

While you should always take heuristics-based decisions with a pinch of salt, following a set of rules and guidelines will head you in the right direction and allow you to spot major usability issues early in your design process. These eight principles are applicable to most user interfaces; they are derived from own Shneiderman’s experience and have been refined over three decades. Others, such as Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman have expanded on these rules and contributed with their own variations. 

You too can use these as inspiration to create your own set of heuristics, or combine the existing examples to solve your own design problems.
