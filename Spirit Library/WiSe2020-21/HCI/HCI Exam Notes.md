# HCI Review Questions
## Intro
___
### HCI

- What is HCI?
    - HCI is a field that is concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive systems for human use and with the major phenomena surrounding them

- What is a user interface?
    - The point of interaction between the human and the computer / the space where interactions between humans and computers occur

### Usability

- Improving usability can
    - increase productivity of users, reduce mistakes
    - reduce costs (vendor support & maitenance, user efficiency)
    - enhance customer loyalty & satisfaction
    - win new customers
- User centered design comprises methods to...
    - understand the use context
    - define requirements
    - develop ideas and concepts
    - work with others
    - create prototypes and evaluate them

### HCI Practice, Research & Innovation

## Usability & UCD Process
___
> Discover → Design → Evaluate → Discover → Design → Evaluate ...
UCD looks at systems **in context**, not at just computers alone

### Usability and The UCD Process

- What are the goals of UCD?
    - **Usefulness**: what functionality is neded?
    - **Usability**: can the product be used in a pleasurable, simple and effective manner?
    - **Desirable**: user experience is good

### Iteration and Context in UCD

### Design Principles - Affordances, Constraints, Mappings and More

- What is an affordance?
	-  An affordance is a relationship between the properties of a physical object and an interacting agent’s (e.g., human, animal, machines, robots) ability to perceive and determine what they can do with that object. For example, a door handle affords to be pushed or pulled

- What is a cosntraint?
	- Constraints impose limitations on the user with regards to how they canuse an object. There are four types of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.
		- Physical constraints restrict what physical operations are allowed. For example, a USB-A plug can only be inserted in a certain orientation. However, USB-C plugs can be inserted in any orientation which means it doesn’t have this physical constraint.
		- Cultural constraints are guidelines and conventions of what normal behavior is and how certain things can be perceived. For example, it is conventional to not look at other passengers while riding an elevator and to look facing the door rather than the rear.
		- Semantic constraints depend on the meaning of the situation to influence the possible actions that can be taken. For example, a flashlight is used to better illuminate a certain area. If you want to better see what is in front of you, you do not point it towards your face.
		- Logical constraints use logical reasoning to help users determine how things can be used to achieve certain results. For example, if someone were doing a puzzle, and there is one piece left, the user can infer that the last piece they have is the one meant to go in empty space.
- What is a mapping?
	-  A mapping is the relationship between two things: the control and its expected result. If users press the light switch on the left side, they expect the light on the left side to turn on. When you press the right arrow key when using a text editor, the cursor moves to the right and when pressing the left, the cursor moves to the left.

### Programmer's Guide to the Human

## Requirements Analysis
___
### What are Requirements?

- What are requirements?

### Different Types of Requirements

- What types of requirements are there?
    - Funcitonal requirements - what the system should do
    - Non functional requirements - constraints on the system, development process
    - Data requirements - what type of data, amount, etc.
    - Environmental/Context of use requirements (physical, social, organizational)

### User Diversity

### Methods: Interviews, Focus Groups, Studying Docu

### Methods: Questionnaires + Indirect Observation

### Methods: Observation, Video, Contextual Enquiry, Diaries

### Methods: closing remarks, mixing methods, considerations for data gathering, informed consent

### Data Analysis

## Usability and UX
___
### Usability vs UX

- What is the difference between usability and user experience?
	-  Usability is focused on tasks that the user needs or wants to be able to complete, whereas user experience is focused on the experiences the user has while using the product. Thus, usability tends to be measured quantifiably and UX is measured qualitatively

- What is the gulf of execution?
	- The difference between the user's intentions and the allowable actions
		- Can the user tell what actions are possible?
		- Does the interface help map from intention to physical movement?
		- Do the actions that can be taken in the system match the intended actions?
		- Does the device easily support required actions?
- What is the gulf of evaluation?
	- The amount of effort needed to interpret the system state regarding the original intention
		- Can the user easily tell what state the system is in?
		- Can the user tell if it is in the desired state?
		- Is information about the system state legible, whether it matches  intentions?

### Usability Principles and Heuristics

- 5 components of usability as described by Jakon Nielsen
    - Learnability
		- How easy it is for users to accomplish a basic task the first time they encounter the design → Visibility of system status, match with real world, consistency (predictability, synthesizability, familiarity, consistency)
    - Efficiency
		- How quickly can users perform tasks → user control, freedom/flexibility
    - Memorability
		- How easily can users reestablish their proficiency at using the design after a period of not using it → recognition vs recall
    - Errors
		- Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from erros → error prevention
    - Satisfaction
		- How pleasant is it to use the design?
    - Help & Documentation (added later)
- Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules + 2 Principles
	- Recognize user diversity (e.g., who are stakehodlers and their key tasks)
	- Consistency (internal/external, color coding, button placement, etc.)
	- Provide shortcuts for experts
	- Feedback (appropriate + informative)
	- Closure (user should recognize the task is done - where am I, progress status, etc)
	- Prevent errors (make it hard to do errors, auto detect errors)
	- Easy reversal (undo)
	- User should feel in control
	- Reduce short-term memory load (recognition over recall)
- What are Dix's Usability Principles?
	- Learnability and Flexibility
- What is the difference between internal and external consistency?
	- Internal consistency is the consistency of colors, language and other design features between different parts of an interface, whereas external consistency is the consistency of design with other applications on the same platform or with standards out in the world (e.g., an 'x' button typicallly symbolizes closing)
### UX - Intro and Design of Interactions
- What is Chris Crawford's Conversation Metaphor for interactions?
	- Interactions, just like conversations, require 2 actors to listen to each other, think, and respond. The quality of interaction relies on the quality of all sub-activities
- What can lead to a good interaction?
	- a balance of contributions the user must have
	- engage and motivate the user with the activity, ask: what can the user do?
- What is the shared control mechnaism/paradigm in artificial intelligence?
	- a system that uses both user control and an automation component. the human and the robot/AI act as peers and can act independently from each other

### UX - Joy of Use and Use qualities
- What is interaction design?
	- "the art of effectively creating valuable, meaningful, interesting, compelling & empowering information, interactions & experiences for other people"
- What is the Hygiene model and the Motivation model?
	- People are fine with something if it is hygienic, but when something isn't hygienic, then people are dissatisfied. Satisfiers provide motivation.
	- Classical HCI focused on hygiene factors: fulfilling expectations, having no errors (efficient, effective), and having a reduction of stress - avoiding negative emotions = hygiene
- Explain Hassenzahl's model of user experience
	- He models user experience by splitting its qualities by whether it is hedonic or pragmatic (more emotional or practical)
		- Pragmatic
			- Utility (necessary functions for a given task)
			- Usability (easy and efficient)
		- Hedonic
			- Stimulation (ability of a product to surprise, foster curiosity, and provide opportunities for the perfection of knowledge and skills)
			- Beauty/Attractiveness (ability of product to evoke a feeling of 'beauty')
			- Communicative identity (ability to communicate self-serving symbols to relevant others)
- Example of use qualities in UX
	- Playability
	- Seduction
	- Efficiency + Transparency
	- Relevance, utility
	- Pliability, responsiveness
	- Immersion
	- Identity
	- Empowerment, Flexibility
	- Elegance
	- Surprise
## Cognition and Design
___
### Cognition and its role for Design
- Name some cognitive processes
	- Attention
	- Perception and recognition
	- Memory
	- Learning
	- Reading, speaking and listening
	- Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision making
- What is attention, and what are its design implications?
	- Attention is selecting things to concentrate on at a point in time from the mass of stimuli around us
	- We should limit the amount of information in UIs so that they're not cluttered with too much information
- What is perception and its design implications?
	- Perception is related to how informaiton is acquired from the world and transformed into experiences
	- We should design representations that are readily and easily perceivable
		- text: legible and distinguishable from the background
		- icons: easily distinguishable and understandable meaning
		- sounds: audible and distinguishable
		- tactile: allow users to recognize and distinguish different meanings
- What are the three types of memory function? How does memory work?
	- Sensory memories: continuously overwritte, short term buffer for each modality
	- Short-term memory/working memory: 7 +/- 2 chunks, rapid access, rapid decay
	- Long-term memory: slow access, slow decay, selective, interferences
	- Information is encoded, and then processed
- What is easier: recognition or recall?
	- Recognition! For example, it is much easier for someone to use a GUI than a command line interface (e.g., GitHub Desktop v.s. remembering git commands for a command-line input)
- Why does the 7 +/- 2 idea not work for UIs? For example, having 7 buttons in a menu or displaying 7 icons on a tool bar
	- Because what's presented on an interface isn't about recall, rather recognition - users can scan through the UI without having to use their memory
- What are some design implications regarding memory?
	- don't overload users' memories with complicated procedures
	- design UIs that promote recognition rather than recall
	- encode information in various ways (categories, color, flagging, time, etc.)
	- more complex interactions can be designed to optimize for both types of memory processes (e.g., search box - recall, history list - recognition)
- How do people prefer to learn? What are design implications for learning?
	- People prefer to learn by doing rather than reading instructions
	- Design interfaces that encourage exploration, constratin and guide learners
	- Dynamically linking concepts and representations can facilitate the learning of complex material
- What are design applications of reading, speaking and listening?
	- The ease with which people can read, listen or speak differs (some people prefer listening to reading, reading can be quicker than the others, listening requries less cognitive effort, dislexics have trouble with written text...)
	- Provide several input modalities (e.g, keyboard, voice input, natural-language systems)
	- Provide several output modalities (e.g., normal text, text-to-speech systems)
- Problem solving, planning, reasoning, and decision making and its design implications
	- Requires the most cognition to be able to reflect (on what to do, the options, and the consequences), use conscious processes, discuss with others and use artifacts (e.g., map, books, pen and paper), and may involve working through different scenarios to decide on the best option
	- Provide additional info/functions for users who wish to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively, use simple computational aids to support rapid decision-making and planning for users on the move
- What are the two types of errors?
	- Slips and mistakes. Slips are when the users have the right intention but fail to do it right. Mistakes are when users misunderstand something and have the wrong intention 
### Mental and Conceptual Models
> The conceptual model is **how we want the user to understand** the system, and the mental model is **how the user comes to understand** the system and we want them to match!
- What is a mental model?
	- A user's understanding of a system through their learning and using of it
- What is a conceptual model?
	- a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates
	- components of a conceptual model
		- metaphors and analogies: help understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity
		- concepts that people are exposed to through the product: tas-domain objects, their attributes, and operations (e.g., saving, revisiting, organizing)
		- relationship and mappings between these concepts
- Information processing model of cognition
	- a user interacting with a computer is like information processing
	- 
- Why do some models of cognition not adequately represent how humans interact with computers?
	- they don't account for the environment/context in which the user is interacting with the computer; there can be external factors
	- ![[Information Processing Model of Cognition.png]]

### Alternative models of Cognition: Distributed Cognition
- What is the distributed cognition model of cognition?
	- It's concerned with cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts and internal and external representations. Involves the environment and context where the information can be propogated across different representations (paper, from other people, from computer, etc.)
- What's the difference between the traditional model and the distributed model of cognition?
	- The traditional model views an individual as the sole actor in cognition where input is taken and then ouput is given wheres the distributed model represents the multiple processes that may happen between several people and computers as well as the various representations of information that can be present
- What is involved with distributed cognition?
	- distributed problem solving
	- verbal, non-verbal behaviors
	- sharing and access of knowledge
	- coordination mechanisms (rules, procedures...)
	- external artifacts (calendars, post its, lists, heaps of stuff...) used to trigger yourself
	- annotation and computational offloading
- 3 ways cognition is distributed
	- socially
	- internally / externally
	- through time

### Interface Metaphors
> Using metaphors explot user's familiar knowledge to understand the unfamiliar
- What metaphors are used in most online shopping websites?
	- shopping cart, checkout, basket, 1-click, gift wrapping
- Benefits of interface metaphors and problems
	- makes learning new systems easier
	- helps users understand the underlying conceptual model
	- can be very innovative
	- can increase accessibility to greater diversity of users
- Possible downsides of metaphors
	- may break conventional and cultural rules
	- can constrain designers in how to conceptualize problem space
	- conflicts with design principles
	- force users to *only* understand system in terms of the metaphor
	- designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer bad parts over
	- limits designers' imagination
- Why are enchanted objects such a popular metaphor for modern technologies? Can you explain why this might be a useful analogy? What's missing from the metaphor? (e.g., Magic wand 'Wiimote')
	- This analogy can be useful because its form is similar to what may already be familiar to the user. However, the metaphor might not make sense to people from a different cultural background or may only work inside a specific context - "enchanted object" needs to be more specific for the use case
- 3 steps for designing good metaphors
	- understand functionality
	- identify problem areas (for users) - choose metaphor to support this
	- generate metaphors
- Benefits of conceptualizing 
	- Orientation: enables design teams to ask specific questions about how the conceptual model witll be understood
	- Open-minded: prevents design teams from becoming narrowly focused early on
	- Common ground: allows design teams to establish a set of commonly agreed terms

### Interaction Styles
> These are metaphors for interaction, and they're good for different purposes. When choosing which style to use, determine the requirements and user needs, take into account constraints like budget, and it depends on suitability of technology for the activity/task
- Types of Interactions
	- Instructing
	- Conversing
	- Manipulating
	- Exploring
	- Proactive computing (computer acts based on assumed needs of the user (automatic filtering, software agents))
- What is instructing?
	- users instruct a system and tell it what to do
	- benefit: supports quick and efficient interaction and good for repetitive kinds of actions on multiple objects
- What is conversing?
	- interactions that mimic the interaction of having a conversation (e.g., timetables, search engines, help systems)
- Pros & cons of conversational model
	- Pros
		- allows users, especially novices and technophones to interact with the system in a familiar way, makes them feel comfortable
	- Cons
		- misunderstandings can arise when the system doesn't know how to parse what the user says
- What's manipulating?
	- dragging, selecting opening, closing and zooming actions on virtual objects - exploits users' knowledge of how they move and manipulate in the physical world
- Benefits of direct manipulation?
	- Gives user feeling of being in direct control
	- immediate feedback to users
	- novices can learn basic functionality quickly
	- experienced users can work quickly and do a range of tasks
	- intermittent users can retain operational concepts
- Disadvantages with direct manipulation
	- taking metaphor of direct manipulation too literally
	- not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly
	- some tasks can be better achieved by delegating
	- can waste screen estate
	- can be slower
	- mistakes can be hard to fix
- What is exploring?
	- involves users moving through virtual or physical environments
	- physical environments with embedded sensor technologies
- What is proactive computing?
	- the system tries to predict the future (e.g., physical: sliding doors, digital: google, facebook suggestions)
	- can speed up processes and relieve the user from tasks, but can also distract the user and be error prone 

## Early Design
___
### Why Do Prototyping?
- What is a prototype?
	- A limited representation of a design which allows people to interact with it and to explore and check its suitability
- Reasons to prototype
    - fast and inexpensive - allows iteration and sketching of multiple ideas
    - rapid prototyping enables design team to evaluate more design options in detail
    - identify problems before they are coded
    - elicits more and more focused feedback
    - helps to think more creatively
    - gets users and other stakehodlers involved early
    - fosters teamwork and communication
    - being concrete helps to avoid opinion wars

### Users and Use Contexts - Personas and Scenarios
*Focuses on users and the use situation*
- What are personas?
	- Textual descriptions/representations of archetypical or extreme fictional users
		- Grounded in background info/data
		- Usually done in a set
		- Representative of the target audience
		- Rich with details to bring to life so that designers can more easily talk about them
- What are scenarios
	- Textual descriptions of users in situations. It's the narrative that describes how the persona behaves as a sequence of events
	- concrete stories for design
	- set of stories around essential tasks, problems, etc.
	- Focused on user needs
	- can be presented in text, comic strip, video, acting
	- **Note:** dark scenarios are scenarios focused on the negative and problematic aspects of a situation (that could then be sovled by a product)
- What is a situation scenario?
     - A scenario that concentrates on a specific situation and focuses on goals and overall actions of the user, not on specific details like button presses. Illustrates the use of a product's function in a specific context as well as the requirements and impact of the product
- Pros and cons of scenarios
    - life and time are linear
    - easy to understand
    - concrete
    - can be used throughout the UCD process to illustrate the status quo as well as envisioned use
- Cons of scenarios
    - no choice, no branches, no special conditions
    - easy to miss the unintended
    - a lot of text to read
- What is a storyboard?
    - Sketches that either show the walkthrough of an interface's screens (interface storyboard) or the use of a system in an everyday use context. Can also be done with photos

### Sketching and Paper Prototyping
*Focuses on interface & system design*
- What is a wireframe? aka blueprint/schematic
    - A visual representation of user interface, stripped of visual design or branding
    - used to lay out content and functionality on a page but with a focus on information architecture
    - also used to design interaction flow
- Pros of user-testing user paper prototypes
    - cheap and easy, quick iterations
    - early user testing, proof of concept
    - elicit similar feedback as for more refined prototypes
    - make mistakes on paper and not in coding 🙂
- Cons of user testing with paper prototypes
    - User feedback depends strongly how prototype is explained and handled
    - Not all use cases can be tested
    - Don't include features that are technically not feasible
    - Limits of what can be tested

### Mockups & Video Prototyping
*Focuses on interface & system design*
- What is a mockup?
    - A physical emulation of a product or system focused on user experience and interaction
- What is wizard of oz prototyping?
    - A method used in early user testing in which the computer is replaced with human who emulates the computer's responses and interaction between it and the user. It can be used to test how users react and whether functionality seems plausible, but a downside is that the wizard has human intelligence and reaction time.
- What is a video prototype?
    - It's like a storyboard but more detailed, realistic, and can focus on the scenario of use or the interace. However it is non interactive.

### Medium & Hi-Fi Prototyping, Typology/Categorization

> Hi-Fi and functional prototypes should be done towards the end of the prototyping process, but sometimes may be necessary to do earlier (e.g., when time-based behavior is a crucial part of the system design

- What's a medium fidelity prototype?
    - A functional but sketchy  prototype, or a powerpoint with specified transitions and effects

- What's a high fidelity prototype?
    - A prototype that looks and feels similarly to the final system. They're usually designed within a restricted scope (i.e., vertical or horizontal) and can sometimes simulate functionality using dummy data and other methods

- What's a horizontal prototype
    - A prototype that is designed to illustrate a variety of features, but not in great detail.

- What's a vertical prototype?
    - A prototype that focuses on one functionality in depth

- What's a functional prototype?
    - What software engineering refers to as a prototype that uses code and works. Can be horizontal or vertical, and doesn't have to look like how end result is going to look.

- Pros to functional/hifi prototypes?
    - Design team can show how product will look and feel
    - Users can use the product in given tasks
    - Task efficiency can be predicted based on prototype
- Cons to functional/hifi prototypes?
    - may be time consuming
    - users can only use and test the implemented functions
    - feedback may focus around the look and feel
    - less willingness of users to criticize overall approach
    - risk that managers confuse the prototype with a fully working system. they may think the software is ready because it looks close to the end result.

### Experience Prototyping

- What is experience prototyping?

    - A method that allows designers to gain empathy for users and their situation through active interaction with the system in the same context/environment the user would use it. Not prototyping the system, but the experience

## Evaluation
___
### Intro & Categorization of approaches

- What is the double diamond design process?
- What's the difference between analytical evaluation and empirical evaluation?
    - **Analytical** methods simulate the people based on heuristics, procedures, known methods and measures (e.g., heuristic eval., Fitts Law, KLM, etc.)
    - **Empirical** methods involve real people
    - (experience prototyping doesn't fit in this taxonomy)

- What's the difference between a formative evaluation and a summative evaluation?
    *The difference is when the evaluations are done* in the design process. Summative evaluations are done at the end and evaluate the final product whereas formative evaluations are done earlier in the process and are used to inform design decisions to further the product (e.g., early prototype)

- Why, what, where and when to evaluate?
    - **Why**: check users' requirements and that users can use the product and like it
    - **What**: conceptual model, early prototypes of a new system and later, more complete prototypes
    - **Where**: in natural and laboratory settings
    - **When**: throughout design; or evaluate finished products to inform new products

### Heuristic Evaluation / Inspection / Expert Review
- What is a heuristic evaluation?
    - An approach to predict usability problems using a set of usability criteria (heuristics). Experts will walk through pre determined scenarios while noting possible problems with the usability and simulating user behavior
- Are heuristic evaluations an analytical or empirical evaluation?
    - Analytical, because they don't involve any users, but rather they use known procedures and measures to simulate user behavior
- Advantages of heuristic evaluation
    - Debugs design
    - Users don't have to be present
    - Few ethical and practical issues to consider
    - Quick and easy
- Disadvantages/Problems of heuristic evaluation
    - Can be difficult and expensive to find experts
    - Important problems may get missed
    - Trivial problems are identified
    - Experts have biases, pet peeves, blind spots
    - Finding experts with domain expertise
- Examples of heuristics
    - Visibillity of system status
    - Match between system and the real world (system should use words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user)
    - User control and freedom (support undo and redo)
    - Consistency and standards
    - Error prevention (even better than good error messages)
    - Recognition rather han recall (minimize memory load)
    - Flexibility and efficiency of use (tailoring, expert user mode)
    - Aesthetic and minimalist design (no irrelevant information)
    - Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
    - Help and documentation (should be provided)

### Empirical Methods & Usability Studies

- Why use empirical methods?
    - Human behavior is difficult to predict, but easy to observe

- Different types of empirical methods
    - Controlled experiments (isolate effect of a design element on a dependent variable)
    - Field experiments in natural setting
    - Observation in lab (usability study)
    - Observation in the real world / longitudinal study / in the wild study
  
- How to prepare for a usability test?
    - Look for representative users
    - Design typical tasks and scenarios
    - 5-10 test users
    - Tasks <30 minutes formulated in terms of realistic and doable user goals
    - Identical conditions across participants (script introduction, presentation of system and tasks)
    
- Ways to collect data in a usability test
    - Screen logging
    - Video taping (user, screen, keyboard, room)
    - Audio taping (loud thinking, user discussion)
    - Direct observation

### Examples: Think Aloud, Cooperative Evaluation

Important to have participants understand that they are not being evaluated, but the product

- What is the think aloud technique?
	- The user performs a task, and is observed. The user describes what they are doing and why, what they think is happening, etc.
- Advantages to the think aloud technique
    - Simplicity - requires little expertise compared to methods like the heuristic evaluation
    - Provides useful insight, reveals opinions, reactions and attitudes
    - Can show how system is actually used
- Disadvantages to the think aloud technique
    - Subjective, selective
    - Disrups concentration on task
    - Act of describing may alter performance (e.g., mood of playing a game)
    - Bad for understanding perceptual phenomena
- What is a cooperative evaluation
    - like a think aloud, but the users aren't as aware
    - users and evaluators can ask each other questions
- Advantages to cooperative evaluation
    - easier and more natural
    - less constrained, user is encouraged to criticize system
    - clarificaiton possible
- What is a post-task walkthrough
    - Video/transcript played back to participant to comment
    - useful to identify reasons fro actions and alternatives considered and can be done in cases wehre think-aloud is not possible "why did you do this? What did you expect to happen"
- What is Agile Usability testing (Guerrilla Usability Testing)
    - Frequent continual testing (every 1-2 weeks), giving feedback to developers for next iteration.
    - 3 people per iteration
    - Guerrilla - ask people waiting for their coffee in cafes, co workers, etc. to test product that doesn't take too much time

### Examples: Living Labs, Incident Diary, A-B Testing
- What is a living lab?
	- A living lab is a testing method that simulates a real setting (home, dance floor, classroom) with fully functional prototypes installed
- What is an incident diary?
	- A testing method for deployed software where the users write a page in a diary or an audio note for each interaction problem they have
- What is A-B testing?
	- A testing method for deployed softwhere where there's 2 versions running, and the users don't know which version they're seeing. There's an ethical issue that users don't know that they're being experimented on.

### Field Studies 
- What is a field study?
    - A field study is a way to test something in which it is conducted in a natural and real environment. The environment the product would be tested in would be the same one in which it would be actually used. They are harder to control and are a good way to see how technological innovations may or may not be useful

### Examples: Field study, combining usability & field studies in development/research process

### Reporting on evaluations, general issues, summary

## Modeling User Interaction
___
### Intro; descriptive methods: HTA
- What is a descriptive model?
	- a model that provides conceptual framework that simplifies a system, allows statemsnts about likely characteristics. gives a basis for understanding, reflecting and reasoning about facts and interactions
- What is a predictive model?
	- a model that makes **educated guesses about the future** based on model of interaction (based on empiritcal knowledge), often predict performance
- What is hierarchical task analysis (HTA)?
	- a way to model user tasks by identifying main tasks for achieving a user goal, and breaking those tasks into sub tasks. usually focused on physical and observable actions
	- ![[Hierarchical Task Analysis.png]]
- What are the pros of HTAs?
	- you can compare designs based on user tasks and it supports understanding at varying levels of abstraction
- What are the cons of HTAs?
	- It is difficult to represent complex real-world tasks
	- can't model overlapping, parallel tasks or interruptions
	- results in inflexible workflow if implemented too directly
### Descriptive Models (GOMS, 3-state Interaction, Bimanual Skills)
- What is the GOMS model?
	- a descriptive model that splits user tasks into goals that are achieved by solving sub goals in a divide and conquer fashion, and has more of a focus on cognitive aspects than HTA
	- Goals
		- Verbal description of what a user wants to accomplish at various levels of abstraction or complexity
	- Operators
		- Possible basic actions in the system (various levels of abstraction possible : sub goals, keystrokes, etc.)
	- Methods
		- sequences of operators that achieve a goal
	- Selection rules
		- rules that define when a suer emplys which method
- What is the 3 state model?
	- A method that describes graphical input (i.e., mice, button presses, etc.)

- What is Guiard's Model of Bimanual skills?
	- Tasks are asymmetrical with regard to left and right hands. This model identifies the role of the non dominant and dominant hands 
	- The non dominant guides the dominant hand and does more coarse movements, whereas the dominant/preferred hand performs fine/detailed actions. Non-dominant hand creates a frame of reference for dominant one (think of writing/drawing, putting thread in needle)
	- Application: can use when designing interactions for systems with bimanual interactions like VR
### Fitts' Law
- What is Fitts' Law?
	- It's a robust predictive model of human psychomotor (brain and muscles involved) behavior that predicts movement time for rapid, aimed pointing tasks. It describes movement time in terms of distance & size of target and device. Purely ergonomic, doesn't take into account cognitive aspects of user behavior.
	- ID (index of difficulty) predicts achievable speed of selecting target
	- The time to acquire a target is a function of the **distance** to and **size** of the target and depends on the particular **pointing system** 
	- $MT = a + b\log_{2} \left ( 1 + \frac{D}{W}\right )$
		- MT: movement time
		- a and b: constants dependent on the pointing system (in seconds) - a is start/stop time and b is inherent speed
		- D: distance to the target area
		- W: width of the target
		- $ID = \log_{2} \left ( 1 + \frac{D}{W}\right )$ - describes difficulty of task independent of device
### Fitts' Law for new devices; Implications for Interface Design
- What might Fitts' Law tell us about interface design?
	- Bigger Buttons are easier to hit - use them for buttons that aremore common to press
	- Use cursor location for pop up menus to minimize travel distance
	- Use edges and corners of screen - "infinite height and width", cursor stops no matter the speed (think of mac menus on top of screen)
- Is pointing on a touchscreen the same as a screen with a mouse?
	- No, because the mouse stops at the edge, a touch screen is a normal target for Fitts' law
- What is the most optimal menu type according to Fitts' Law?
	- Pie menus because similarly to pop up menus, it pops up where the mouse is, and all of the options are at an equal distance from the mouse. It also helps build muscle memorey. BUT labeling is difficult and uses more screen space
- What is the Steering Law?
	- A law that models movement time of a pointer through a 2D tunnel to aquire a target
	- $MT = a + b \frac{D}{W}$
	- ID is linear, not logarithmic, steering is more difficult than pointing!
- What's an example of Steering Law in Practice?
	- Nested menus like in Spotify. It's very easy to accidentally go out of the tunnel which would make the menu disappear
- What's the idea of a crossing menu?
	- You cross an item to select it, which allows you to easily select multiple things without having to slow down. Based on steering and crossing, is an optimization on Fitts' Law, and is ideal for pen and finger interactions
### Keystroke Level Model (KLM)
> If asked to calculate a KLM time, don't forget reaction times for pages to load, hand from keyboard to mouse
- What is the KLM and how does it work?
	- A predictive model that predicts how much time it takes to execute a task. It's essentially a simplified version of GOMS
	- The execution of a task is decomposed into primitive operators and each operator is assigned a duration of how long it would take a user to perform it
		- Physical motor operators: pressing a button, pointing, drawing a line, etc.
		- Mental operator: preparing for a physical action
		- System response operator: user waits for the system to do something
	- ![[KLM.png]]
- What if you want to use KLM on a different system than the traditional mouse and keyboard?
	- Change and maybe add operators to fit the interactions possible by the system's environment (e.g., G for gesture: time needed for system that uses gestures such as rotating, shaking, drawing numbers in the air)
- What is KLM good for?
	- Helps us identify where common tasks take too long to consist of too many statements, where to simplify. It can also show advantages of new interaction techniques.
- What are advantages of KLM?
	- Quick and easy to apply and prepare
	- Quick to analyze
	- Precise to interpret
	- Easy to convey to management
- What are disadvantages of KLM?
	- Only operators on keystroke-level, so it focuses on very low level tasks
	- No multiple goals
	- Strictly sequential
### Recap of Traditional Modeling
- What are some downsides to predictive models?
	- Only work for well defined (limited, simple) routine cognitive tasks (out of context)
	- Assuems expert users that know the steps
	- Does not consider slips or erros, fatigue, social surroundings
	- Need to adapt for special user groups with different performance/cognitive behavior
	- Need to empirically determine variables for new interaction methods and styles
