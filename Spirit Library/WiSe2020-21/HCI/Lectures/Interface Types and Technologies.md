## Interface Types and Technologies
___
### Intro. Start WIMP 'types'
- Command-based interfaces
	- steep learning curve, but efficient precise and fast
	- alternative to GUIs for visually impaired users
- WIMP and GUI
	- WIMP: windows, icons, menus, pointing device
	- GUI: same building blocks as WIMPS, but more varied
- What's the difference between an icon, an index and a symbol?
	- The level of similarity between the representation and the referent. It can be:
		- **icon**: similar (e.g., picture of file represents object file, picture of printer)
		- **index**: analogical (picture of scissors to represent 'cut', clouds to represent 'rain'), index points to something, metaphorical
		- **symbol**: arbitrary (use of an X to represent 'delete')
- What menu is best for small amounts of options and which is best for a lot of options?
	- Small: flat menus, large: expanding
- What's the most popular type of menu?
	- Cascading menus
- What are contextual menus?
	- They provide access to often-used commands that make sense in the context of current task
	- Good in terms of Fitts' Law
	- Discovered typically by accident, hide view of current action, may not be possible to fit everything in

### Multimedia, VR, Dashboard Visualization
- What's multimedia?
	- the combination of different media within a single interface with various forms of interactivity
- What's VR?
	- computer-generated graphical simulations providing the illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external observation of such an environment
- Research and design issues related to VR
	- identify effective ways to navigate and interact
	- how best interact with abstract information
	- level of realism needed to engender a sense of present
	- how to prevent motion sickness
	- 'gorilla arm' problem - shoulder pain
	- lack of mechanoreceptive feedback
	- pointer/target misalignments impacting motor control
	- temporal misalignment
	- unnatural gesturing
	- efficient locomotion
- What is InfoViz?
	- Computer-generated interactive graphics of complex data
	- Amplifies human cognition, enabling users to see patterns, trends and amplifies anomalies in complex data
- What are dashboards?
	- shows screenshots of data updated over periods of time - to be read at a glance
	- they're not interactive and need to provide digestible and legible information for users
	- they need to direct users' attention to anomalies and not be cluttered with information

### The Web, Consumer Electronics, Mobiles
- Websites now should be
	- aesthetically pleasing (distinctive? brand identity, fits with user base)
	- usable
	- easy to maintain
	- accommodated for the platform the website is being seen on
- Design implications for consumer electronics and appliances
	- They have interfaces for short interactions so they should be simple/easy to learn, have visibility of the system status, and decide on physical controls vs touch screen control
- What's gained and what's lost if controls of a toaster are replaced with an LCD screen?
	- Gained: less physical space, provide more information, more options
	- Lost: ease of use for visually impaired users, more complex, steeper learning curve
- Advantage of mobile devices
	- real time access to contextual information (scanning bar codes, QR codes, gaming, anytime learning, etc.)
- Things that require design effort regarding mobile phones
	- small screen and limited control space
	- privacy issues
	- usability and preferences vary (e.g., older users)
	- localized experiences
	- dealing with directions, hands free vs being a distractor

### Speech, Pen, and Touch Input
- Applications of speech/voice interfaces
	- timetable, travel planner, ticket purchase, navigators, call routing
	-
