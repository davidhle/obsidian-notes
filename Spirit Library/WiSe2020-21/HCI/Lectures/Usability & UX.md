	## Usability and UX
___
### Usability vs UX

- What is the difference between usability and user experience?
	-  Usability is focused on tasks that the user needs or wants to be able to complete, whereas user experience is focused on the experiences the user has while using the product. Thus, usability tends to be measured quantifiably and UX is measured qualitatively

- What is the gulf of execution?
	- The difference between the user's intentions and the allowable actions
		- Can the user tell what actions are possible?
		- Does the interface help map from intention to physical movement?
		- Do the actions that can be taken in the system match the intended actions?
		- Does the device easily support required actions?
- What is the gulf of evaluation?
	- The amount of effort needed to interpret the system state regarding the original intention
		- Can the user easily tell what state the system is in?
		- Can the user tell if it is in the desired state?
		- Is information about the system state legible, whether it matches  intentions?

### Usability Principles and Heuristics

- 5 components of usability as described by Jakon Nielsen
    - Learnability
		- How easy it is for users to accomplish a basic task the first time they encounter the design → Visibility of system status, match with real world, consistency (predictability, synthesizability, familiarity, consistency)
    - Efficiency
		- How quickly can users perform tasks → user control, freedom/flexibility
    - Memorability
		- How easily can users reestablish their proficiency at using the design after a period of not using it → recognition vs recall
    - Errors
		- Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors → error prevention
    - Satisfaction
		- How pleasant is it to use the design?
    - Help & Documentation (added later)
- Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules + 2 Principles
	- Recognize user diversity (e.g., who are stakeholders and their key tasks)
	- Consistency (internal/external, color coding, button placement, etc.)
	- Provide shortcuts for experts
	- Feedback (appropriate + informative)
	- Closure (user should recognize the task is done - where am I, progress status, etc)
	- Prevent errors (make it hard to do errors, auto detect errors)
	- Easy reversal (undo)
	- User should feel in control
	- Reduce short-term memory load (recognition over recall)
- What are Dix's Usability Principles?
	- Learnability and Flexibility
- What is the difference between internal and external consistency?
	- Internal consistency is the consistency of colors, language and other design features between different parts of an interface, whereas external consistency is the consistency of design with other applications on the same platform or with standards out in the world (e.g., an 'x' button typically symbolizes closing)
### UX - Intro and Design of Interactions
- What is Chris Crawford's Conversation Metaphor for interactions?
	- Interactions, just like conversations, require 2 actors to listen to each other, think, and respond. The quality of interaction relies on the quality of all sub-activities
- What can lead to a good interaction?
	- a balance of contributions the user must have
	- engage and motivate the user with the activity, ask: what can the user do?
- What is the shared control mechanism/paradigm in artificial intelligence?
	- a system that uses both user control and an automation component. the human and the robot/AI act as peers and can act independently from each other

### UX - Joy of Use and Use qualities
- What is interaction design?
	- "the art of effectively creating valuable, meaningful, interesting, compelling & empowering information, interactions & experiences for other people"
- What is the Hygiene model and the Motivation model?
	- People are fine with something if it is hygienic, but when something isn't hygienic, then people are dissatisfied. Satisfiers provide motivation.
	- Classical HCI focused on hygiene factors: fulfilling expectations, having no errors (efficient, effective), and having a reduction of stress - avoiding negative emotions = hygiene
- Explain Hassenzahl's model of user experience
	- He models user experience by splitting its qualities by whether it is hedonic or pragmatic (more emotional or practical)
		- Pragmatic
			- Utility (necessary functions for a given task)
			- Usability (easy and efficient)
		- Hedonic
			- Stimulation (ability of a product to surprise, foster curiosity, and provide opportunities for the perfection of knowledge and skills)
			- Beauty/Attractiveness (ability of product to evoke a feeling of 'beauty')
			- Communicative identity (ability to communicate self-serving symbols to relevant others)
- Example of use qualities in UX
	- Playability
	- Seduction
	- Efficiency + Transparency
	- Relevance, utility
	- Pliability, responsiveness
	- Immersion
	- Identity
	- Empowerment, Flexibility
	- Elegance
	- Surprise
