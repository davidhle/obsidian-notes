## Early Design
___
### Why Do Prototyping?
- What is a prototype?
	- A limited representation of a design which allows people to interact with it and to explore and check its suitability
- Reasons to prototype
    - fast and inexpensive - allows iteration and sketching of multiple ideas
    - rapid prototyping enables design team to evaluate more design options in detail
    - identify problems before they are coded
    - elicits more and more focused feedback
    - helps to think more creatively
    - gets users and other stakeholders involved early
    - fosters teamwork and communication
    - being concrete helps to avoid opinion wars

### Users and Use Contexts - Personas and Scenarios
*Focuses on users and the use situation*
- What are personas?
	- Textual descriptions/representations of archetypical or extreme fictional users
		- Grounded in background info/data
		- Usually done in a set
		- Representative of the target audience
		- Rich with details to bring to life so that designers can more easily talk about them
- What are scenarios
	- Textual descriptions of users in situations. It's the narrative that describes how the persona behaves as a sequence of events
	- concrete stories for design
	- set of stories around essential tasks, problems, etc.
	- Focused on user needs
	- can be presented in text, comic strip, video, acting
	- **Note:** dark scenarios are scenarios focused on the negative and problematic aspects of a situation (that could then be solved by a product)
- What is a situation scenario?
     - A scenario that concentrates on a specific situation and focuses on goals and overall actions of the user, not on specific details like button presses. Illustrates the use of a product's function in a specific context as well as the requirements and impact of the product
- Pros and cons of scenarios
    - life and time are linear
    - easy to understand
    - concrete
    - can be used throughout the UCD process to illustrate the status quo as well as envisioned use
- Cons of scenarios
    - no choice, no branches, no special conditions
    - easy to miss the unintended
    - a lot of text to read
- What is a storyboard?
    - Sketches that either show the walkthrough of an interface's screens (interface storyboard) or the use of a system in an everyday use context. Can also be done with photos

### Sketching and Paper Prototyping
*Focuses on interface & system design*
- What is a wireframe? aka blueprint/schematic
    - A visual representation of user interface, stripped of visual design or branding
    - used to lay out content and functionality on a page but with a focus on information architecture
    - also used to design interaction flow
- Pros of user-testing user paper prototypes
    - cheap and easy, quick iterations
    - early user testing, proof of concept
    - elicit similar feedback as for more refined prototypes
    - make mistakes on paper and not in coding ðŸ™‚
- Cons of user testing with paper prototypes
    - User feedback depends strongly how prototype is explained and handled
    - Not all use cases can be tested
    - Don't include features that are technically not feasible
    - Limits of what can be tested

### Mockups & Video Prototyping
*Focuses on interface & system design*
- What is a mockup?
    - A physical emulation of a product or system focused on user experience and interaction
- What is wizard of oz prototyping?
    - A method used in early user testing in which the computer is replaced with human who emulates the computer's responses and interaction between it and the user. It can be used to test how users react and whether functionality seems plausible, but a downside is that the wizard has human intelligence and reaction time.
- What is a video prototype?
    - It's like a storyboard but more detailed, realistic, and can focus on the scenario of use or the interface. However it is non interactive.

### Medium & Hi-Fi Prototyping, Typology/Categorization
> Hi-Fi and functional prototypes should be done towards the end of the prototyping process, but sometimes may be necessary to do earlier (e.g., when time-based behavior is a crucial part of the system design
- What's a medium fidelity prototype?
    - A functional but sketchy  prototype, or a powerpoint with specified transitions and effects
- What's a high fidelity prototype?
    - A prototype that looks and feels similarly to the final system. They're usually designed within a restricted scope (i.e., vertical or horizontal) and can sometimes simulate functionality using dummy data and other methods
- What's a horizontal prototype
    - A prototype that is designed to illustrate a variety of features, but not in great detail.
- What's a vertical prototype?
    - A prototype that focuses on one functionality in depth
- What's a functional prototype?
    - What software engineering refers to as a prototype that uses code and works. Can be horizontal or vertical, and doesn't have to look like how end result is going to look.
- Pros to functional/hifi prototypes?
    - Design team can show how product will look and feel
    - Users can use the product in given tasks
    - Task efficiency can be predicted based on prototype
- Cons to functional/hifi prototypes?
    - may be time consuming
    - users can only use and test the implemented functions
    - feedback may focus around the look and feel
    - less willingness of users to criticize overall approach
    - risk that managers confuse the prototype with a fully working system. they may think the software is ready because it looks close to the end result.

### Experience Prototyping
- What is experience prototyping?

    - A method that allows designers to gain empathy for users and their situation through active interaction with the system in the same context/environment the user would use it. Not prototyping the system, but the experience
