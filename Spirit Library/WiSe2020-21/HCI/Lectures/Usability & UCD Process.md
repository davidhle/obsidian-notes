UCD looks at systems **in context**, not at just computers alone

### Usability and The UCD Process

- What are the goals of UCD?
    - **Usefulness**: what functionality is neded?
    - **Usability**: can the product be used in a pleasurable, simple and effective manner?
    - **Desirable**: user experience is good

### Design Principles - Affordances, Constraints, Mappings and More

- What is an affordance?
	-  An affordance is a relationship between the properties of a physical object and an interacting agent’s (e.g., human, animal, machines, robots) ability to perceive and determine what they can do with that object. For example, a door handle affords to be pushed or pulled

- What is a constraint?
	- Constraints impose limitations on the user with regards to how they can use an object. There are four types of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.
		- Physical constraints restrict what physical operations are allowed. For example, a USB-A plug can only be inserted in a certain orientation. However, USB-C plugs can be inserted in any orientation which means it doesn’t have this physical constraint.
		- Cultural constraints are guidelines and conventions of what normal behavior is and how certain things can be perceived. For example, it is conventional to not look at other passengers while riding an elevator and to look facing the door rather than the rear.
		- Semantic constraints depend on the meaning of the situation to influence the possible actions that can be taken. For example, a flashlight is used to better illuminate a certain area. If you want to better see what is in front of you, you do not point it towards your face.
		- Logical constraints use logical reasoning to help users determine how things can be used to achieve certain results. For example, if someone were doing a puzzle, and there is one piece left, the user can infer that the last piece they have is the one meant to go in empty space.
- What is a mapping?
	-  A mapping is the relationship between two things: the control and its expected result. If users press the light switch on the left side, they expect the light on the left side to turn on. When you press the right arrow key when using a text editor, the cursor moves to the right and when pressing the left, the cursor moves to the left.
