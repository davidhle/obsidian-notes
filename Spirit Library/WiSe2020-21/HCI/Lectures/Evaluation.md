## Evaluation
___
### Intro & Categorization of approaches
- What is the double diamond design process?
	- 
- What's the difference between analytical evaluation and empirical evaluation?
    - **Analytical** methods simulate the people based on heuristics, procedures, known methods and measures (e.g., heuristic eval., Fitts' Law, KLM, etc.)
    - **Empirical** methods involve real people
    - (experience prototyping doesn't fit in this taxonomy)

- What's the difference between a formative evaluation and a summative evaluation?
    *The difference is when the evaluations are done* in the design process. Summative evaluations are done at the end and evaluate the final product whereas formative evaluations are done earlier in the process and are used to inform design decisions to further the product (e.g., early prototype)
- Why, what, where and when to evaluate?
    - **Why**: check users' requirements and that users can use the product and like it
    - **What**: conceptual model, early prototypes of a new system and later, more complete prototypes
    - **Where**: in natural and laboratory settings
    - **When**: throughout design; or evaluate finished products to inform new products

### Heuristic Evaluation / Inspection / Expert Review
- What is a heuristic evaluation?
    - An approach to predict usability problems using a set of usability criteria (heuristics). Experts will walk through pre-determined scenarios while noting possible problems with the usability and simulating user behavior
- Are heuristic evaluations an analytical or empirical evaluation?
    - Analytical, because they don't involve any users, but rather they use known procedures and measures to simulate user behavior
- Advantages of heuristic evaluation
    - Debugs design
    - Users don't have to be present
    - Few ethical and practical issues to consider
    - Quick and easy
- Disadvantages/Problems of heuristic evaluation
    - Can be difficult and expensive to find experts
    - Important problems may get missed
    - Trivial problems are identified
    - Experts have biases, pet peeves, blind spots
    - Finding experts with domain expertise
- Examples of heuristics (see: [[10 Heuristics Overview]])
    - Visibility of system status
    - Match between system and the real world (system should use words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user)
    - User control and freedom (support undo and redo)
    - Consistency and standards
    - Error prevention (even better than good error messages)
    - Recognition rather than recall (minimize memory load)
    - Flexibility and efficiency of use (tailoring, expert user mode)
    - Aesthetic and minimalist design (no irrelevant information)
    - Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
    - Help and documentation (should be provided)

### Empirical Methods & Usability Studies
- Why use empirical methods?
    - Human behavior is difficult to predict, but easy to observe
- Different types of empirical methods
    - Controlled experiments (isolate effect of a design element on a dependent variable)
    - Field experiments in natural setting
    - Observation in lab (usability study)
    - Observation in the real world / longitudinal study / in the wild study
- How to prepare for a usability test?
    - Look for representative users
    - Design typical tasks and scenarios
    - 5-10 test users
    - Tasks <30 minutes formulated in terms of realistic and doable user goals
    - Identical conditions across participants (script introduction, presentation of system and tasks)
- Ways to collect data in a usability test
    - Screen logging
    - Video taping (user, screen, keyboard, room)
    - Audio taping (loud thinking, user discussion)
    - Direct observation

### Examples: Think Aloud, Cooperative Evaluation
> Important to have participants understand that they are not being evaluated, but the product
- What is the think aloud technique?
	- The user performs a task, and is observed. The user describes what they are doing and why, what they think is happening, etc.
- Advantages to the think aloud technique
    - Simplicity - requires little expertise compared to methods like the heuristic evaluation
    - Provides useful insight, reveals opinions, reactions and attitudes
    - Can show how system is actually used
- Disadvantages to the think aloud technique
    - Subjective, selective
    - Disrupts concentration on task
    - Act of describing may alter performance (e.g., mood of playing a game)
    - Bad for understanding perceptual phenomena
- What is a cooperative evaluation
    - like a think aloud, but the users aren't as aware
    - users and evaluators can ask each other questions
- Advantages to cooperative evaluation
    - easier and more natural
    - less constrained, user is encouraged to criticize system
    - clarificaiton possible
- What is a post-task walkthrough
    - Video/transcript played back to participant to comment
    - useful to identify reasons fro actions and alternatives considered and can be done in cases where think-aloud is not possible "why did you do this? What did you expect to happen"
- What is Agile Usability testing (Guerrilla Usability Testing)
    - Frequent continual testing (every 1-2 weeks), giving feedback to developers for next iteration.
    - 3 people per iteration
    - Guerrilla - ask people waiting for their coffee in cafes, co workers, etc. to test product that doesn't take too much time

### Examples: Living Labs, Incident Diary, A-B Testing
- What is a living lab?
	- A living lab is a testing method that simulates a real setting (home, dance floor, classroom) with fully functional prototypes installed
- What is an incident diary?
	- A testing method for deployed software where the users write a page in a diary or an audio note for each interaction problem they have
- What is A-B testing?
	- A testing method for deployed software where there's 2 versions running, and the users don't know which version they're seeing. There's an ethical issue that users don't know that they're being experimented on.

### Field Studies 
- What is a field study?
    - A field study is a way to test something in which it is conducted in a natural and real environment. The environment the product would be tested in would be the same one in which it would be actually used. They are harder to control and are a good way to see how technological innovations may or may not be useful

### Examples: Field study, combining usability & field studies in development/research process

### Reporting on evaluations, general issues, summary
